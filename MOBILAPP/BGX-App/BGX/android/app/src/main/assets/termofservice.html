	<P class="p36 ft5">Therefore, the purchase of BGX Tokens should be undertaken only by Participants experienced with cryptographic tokens and blockchain based software with a functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens.</P>
	<P class="p36 ft5">By purchasing BGX Tokens, the Participants confirm that they understand and assume the risks involved in such transaction.</P>

BGX Tokens are merely cryptographic tokens existent on the Ethereum blockchain that can enable usage of and interactions with services enabled by BGX Company according to the Whitepaper, after having clarified the regulatory and legal requirements and if successfully completed and deployed;</P>

	<P class="p36 ft23">You must not and agree not to participate in the BGX Crowdsale with an expectation of acquiring an investment or speculating or in pursuit of any profit.

	<P class="p37 ft5">Your Contribution for the purchase of BGX Tokens will be <NOBR>non-refundable.</NOBR> Therefore, you are expected and agree to give full considerations to all risk factors, including but not limited to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and markets in general, risks of systemic failure, risks of code failure, bugs, hardware failure, loss of data, theft, lost usernames, passwords or private keys, incorrectly executed transactions and / or hacks which can lead to the complete or partial loss of the BGX Tokens.</P>
	<P class="p36 ft5">The blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations or introduce new regulations addressing blockchain <NOBR>technology-based</NOBR> applications which may be contrary to the current setup of the BGX Tokens and which may result in substantial modifications or loss of the BGX Tokens.</P>
	<P class="p36 ft5">The field of digital cryptography is very new and for this reason there is a risk of unforeseen attacks on several or all parts of the BGX Token system and / or on the BGX Platform. Despite security measures undertaken by the BGX Company and its affiliated entities, in the event of such an attack / hack, you may lose all or some of your BGX Tokens.</P>
	<P class="p37 ft5">The Participant understands the inherent risks associated with the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, including, but not limited to, those listed hereinafter:</P>
	<P class="p36 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">Risks associated with (intellectual) property rights: the Contributor understands and accepts that, due to a lack of originality of the software and to the immaterial character of the BGX Tokens, there may be no title of ownership in and to the BGX Tokens.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p37 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft33">Risks associated with the blockchain: the Participant understands and accepts that the Smart Contract, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. The Participant understands and accepts that there is no warranty or guarantee that the process for creating BGX Tokens and / or the Ethereum blockchain will be uninterrupted or </SPAN><NOBR>error-free</NOBR> and acknowledges that there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH, other (financial or <NOBR>crypto-financial)</NOBR> support of the Project and / or BGX. The Participant understands and accepts that the Smart Contract and / or underlying protocols and / or any other software involved may either delay and / or not execute a Contribution due to the overall Contribution volume, mining attacks and / or similar events.</P>
	<P class="p5 ft25"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft37">Regulatory risks: the Participant understands and accepts that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the Smart Contract or the BGX Platform Project and which may, inter alias</SPAN><SPAN class="ft38">, </SPAN>result in substantial modifications of the Smart Contract and / or the BGX</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_15">


	<P class="p29 ft5">Platform Project, including its termination and the loss of BGX Tokens for the Participants. BGX Company is in particular exposed in Switzerland to federal, cantonal and municipal regulations embodied in laws and directives in the areas of for example tax and <NOBR>anti-money</NOBR> laundering and it cannot be excluded that changes in the regulatory environment (such as legislation governing <NOBR>anti-money</NOBR> laundering, collective investment schemes, securities trading, <NOBR>crypto-currencies</NOBR> and/or blockchain technology) will adversely affect BGX Company’s business although BGX Company has institutionalized internal processes to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.</P>
	<P class="p32 ft36"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft39">Risks associated with the BGX Token: The BGX Tokens are unsecured. It is unclear whether and to what extend the transfer of the Tokens will be treated under Swiss law. Therefore, the transfer of the Tokens from BGX Company to the Investor and the Investor to another investor may be invalid under Swiss law. The BGX Token may be listed on exchanges in the future, however, BGX Company cannot ensure that an active and liquid trading market for the BGX Tokens will develop and that the market price of the Tokens will not decline. The liquidity of any market will depend on the number of purchasers and sellers, the market for similar instruments and other factors. The price at which the BGX Tokens will trade will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond the BGX Company’s control. In addition, markets based on blockchain companies in general often experience significant price and volume fluctuations. Such fluctuations as well as the economic situation of the financial markets as a whole may have a significant negative effect on the market price of the BGX Tokens, regardless of the operating results and the financial position of BGX Company. Fluctuations in the market price of crypto currencies may result in a negative impact on the market price of BGX Tokens.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p33 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">Risks associated with abandonment / lack of success: the Participant understands and accepts that the creation of the BGX Tokens and the development of the BGX Platform Project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The Participant therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the BGX Platform Project is partially or fully developed and launched, the Participant will receive any benefits through the BGX Tokens held by him / her / it.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p33 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">Risks associated with other applications: the Participant understands and accepts that the BGX Platform Project may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which BGX Tokens will have no intrinsic value.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p33 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">Risks associated with a loss of private key: the Participant understands and accepts that BGX Tokens can only be accessed by using an Ethereum wallet with a combination of Participant's account information (address) and private key or password. The Participant understands and accepts that if his / her / its private key or password gets lost or stolen, the BGX Tokens associated with the Participant's account (address) will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p33 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">Risks associated with your wallet: the Participant understands and accepts that BGX Company or any affiliated entity is in no way responsible for the wallet on which the BGX Tokens are transferred. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for the access and security of your wallet, for any security breach of your wallet and / with any loss of BGX Tokens resulting from your wallet service provider, including fraud, any termination of the service by the wallet provider and / or bankruptcy of the wallet provider. The Participant understands and accepts that the wallet or wallet service provider used for the Contribution, has to be technically compatible with the BGX Tokens. The failure to assure this may have the result that Participant will not gain access to his / her / its BGX Token and lose his / her / its contribution.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p33 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft34">Risks associated with theft / hacks: the Participant understands and accepts that the Smart Contract, the Website, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be</SPAN></P>

	<P class="p33 ft25"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft40">Risks associated with Ethereum mining attacks: the Participant understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to </SPAN><NOBR>double-spend</NOBR> attacks, majority mining power attacks, <NOBR>"selfish-mining”</NOBR> attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract, expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.</P>
	<P class="p46 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">Risks associated with a lack of consensus: the Participant understands and accepts that the network of miners will be ultimately in control of the Smart Contract and that there is no warranty or assurance that the network of miners will allocate the BGX Tokens to the Participants as proposed by these Terms. The Participant further understands that a majority of the miners could agree at any point to make changes to the Smart Contract and to run the new version of the Smart Contract. Such a scenario could lead to the BGX Token losing intrinsic value.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p47 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft41">Risks associated with depreciation: the Participant understands and accepts that with regard to BGX Tokens no market liquidity may be guaranteed and that the value of BGX Tokens over time may experience extreme volatility or depreciate in full.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p48 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft33">Risks associated with forking: the Participant understands and accepts that a group of people may take the software and modify it to accept a different set of tokens, or no tokens at all ("Fork"). The creation of a Fork could substantially devalue the BGX Token.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p47 ft5"><SPAN class="ft36">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft35">Risks associated with BGX liquidity: Contributor understands that with regard to the BGX Tokens no market liquidity may be guaranteed, and that the value (if any) of the BGX Tokens over time may experience extreme volatility or depreciate resulting in loss that will be borne exclusively by the Contributor.</SPAN></P>
	<P class="p49 ft31">By accepting these Terms and by purchasing BGX Tokens, the Participant represents, warrants and accepts that there are certain risks associated with purchase of BGX Tokens, holding BGX Tokens, and using BGX Tokens. By purchasing BGX Tokens, the Participant expressly acknowledges and assumes such risks, including, but not limited to: risk of losing access to the BGX Tokens in his / her possession due to loss of private key(s) or password, as well as any other registration information; risks associated with the BGX Tokens Blockchain; risks of mining attacks; risks of hacking and security weaknesses; risks associated with cryptocurrency markets; as well as risks inherent to technology, internet, blockchain and cryptocurrency.</P>
