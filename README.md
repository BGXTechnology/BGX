# BGX
The digital business ecosystem of tomorrow. Enabling businesses to create shared spaces of customers, data, and loyalty.

BGX is the first open-source distributed ledger focusing on digital assets. BGX provides a seamless and easy integration between businesses â€“ using decentralization to construct shared economic mini-ecosystems.

BGX is a decentralized solution, which eliminates intermediaries and excess, and allows businesses to easily attract new partners. 

The core differentiators of the transformative BGX distributed networks are the hierarchal nature of nodes, the ability to exchange digital assets, not just currency, and the dual token system.

BGX is a new generation ledger without blocks and miners. Nodes are combined into clusters, with each node owned by an independent business. Within a cluster, a quorum is reached of independent, and often competing businesses, which go through several rounds of voting to validate a transaction. 

The now immutable data is then placed in a special structure of the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blocks. 

Nodes also play another important role. By holding a certain amount of ERC-777 DEC tokens, they can emit white-label BGT Coins, a currency native to the network. The high-growth DEC coins cater to the interests of its holders by rising in price, while BGT coins remain stable in price, protecting consumers from volatility.

Moreover, dubious BGT transactions may always be dropped to a third-party public network for verification (Ethereum through DEC), which is protected by Proof-of-Work.
